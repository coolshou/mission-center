summary: Monitor your CPU, Memory, Disk, Network and GPU usage
description: |
  * Monitor overall or per-thread CPU usage
  * See system process, thread, and handle count, uptime, clock speed (base and current), cache sizes
  * Monitor RAM and Swap usage
  * See a breakdown how the memory is being used by the system
  * Monitor Disk utilization and transfer rates
  * Monitor network utilization and transfer speeds
  * See network interface information such as network card name, connection type (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), wireless speeds and frequency, hardware address, IP address
  * Monitor overall GPU usage, video encoder and decoder usage, memory usage and power consumption, powered by the popular NVTOP project
  * See a breakdown of resource usage by app and process
  * Supports a minified summary view for simple monitoring
  * Use accelerated rendering for all the graphs in an effort to reduce CPU and overall resource usage
  * Uses GTK4 and Libadwaita
  * Written in Rust
