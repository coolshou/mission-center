# Mission Center

Monitor your CPU, Memory, Disk, Network and GPU usage with [Mission Center](https://missioncenter.io/)

![](https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/raw/main/screenshots/0001-cpu-multi.png)

## Features

* Monitor overall or per-thread CPU usage
* See system process, thread, and handle count, uptime, clock speed (base and current), cache sizes
* Monitor RAM and Swap usage
* See a breakdown how the memory is being used by the system
* Monitor Disk utilization and transfer rates
* Monitor network utilization and transfer speeds
* See network interface information such as network card name, connection type (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), wireless speeds and
  frequency, hardware address, IP address
* Monitor overall GPU usage, video encoder and decoder usage, memory usage and power consumption, powered by the popular
  NVTOP project
* See a breakdown of resource usage by app and process
* Supports a minified summary view for simple monitoring
* Use OpenGL rendering for all the graphs in an effort to reduce CPU and overall resource usage
* Uses GTK4 and Libadwaita
* Written in Rust
* Flatpak first

## Limitations

Please note there is ongoing work to overcome all of these.

* No per-process network usage ([#3](https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center/-/issues/3))
* GPU support is experimental
  * Intel GPU monitoring is only supported for Broadwell and later GPUs; and does not support VRAM, power, or temperature monitoring.
* When using Linux Mint/Cinnamon, launched applications may not show up in the "Applications" section. (Upstream issue: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/12015)

Please also note that as Mission Center is a libadwaita application, it will not follow system-defined stylesheets (themes).  If you wish to change the look of any libadwaita application, including Mission Center, it is recommended to use [Gradience](https://gradienceteam.github.io/).

## Building and running

### Building - Native

**Requirements:**

* Meson (version >= 0.63)
* Rust (version >= 1.69)
* Python3
* Python GObject Introspection (required for Blueprint)
* DRM development libraries
* GBM development libraries
* udev development libraires
* GTK 4
* libadwaita

**Build instructions**

```bash
# On Ubuntu 23.10 all dependencies, except for the Rust toolchain, can be installed with:
sudo apt install build-essential curl git gettext python3-pip libadwaita-1-dev python3-gi libudev-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev desktop-file-utils meson

meson setup _build -Dbuildtype=debug # Alternatively pass `-Dbuildtype=release` for a release build
ninja -C _build
```

If you want to run the application from the build directory (for development or debugging) some set up is required:

```bash
export PATH="$(pwd)/_build/src/sys_info_v2/gatherer:$PATH"
export GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR="$(pwd)/_build/data"
export HW_DB_DIR="$(pwd)/_build/data/hwdb"
export MC_RESOURCE_DIR="$(pwd)/_build/resources"

glib-compile-schemas --strict "$(pwd)/data" && mv "$(pwd)/data/gschemas.compiled" "$(pwd)/_build/data/"
```

And then to run the app:

```bash
_build/src/missioncenter
```

If you want to install the app just run:

```bash
ninja -C _build install
```

And run the app from your launcher or from the command-line:

```bash
missioncenter
```

### Building - AppImage

```bash
# On Ubuntu 23.10 all dependencies, except for the Rust toolchain, can be installed with:
sudo apt install build-essential curl git gettext python3-pip libadwaita-1-dev python3-gi libudev-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev desktop-file-utils meson

meson setup _build -Dbuildtype=debug # Alternatively pass `-Dbuildtype=release` for a release build
ninja -C _build
```

And then build the AppImage:

```bash
meson install -C _build --no-rebuild --destdir "AppDir"

appimage-builder --appdir _build/AppDir/ 
```

And run the app from the command-line:

```bash
./"Mission Center-${version}-${arch}.AppImage"
```

### Building - Flatpak

**Requirements:**

* Flatpak
* Flatpak-Builder

Add the `flathub` repo is not already present:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Install the required Flatpak runtimes and SDKs:

```bash
flatpak install -y \
    org.freedesktop.Platform//23.08 \
    org.freedesktop.Sdk//23.08 \
    org.gnome.Platform//45 \
    org.gnome.Sdk//45
```

Finally build a Flatpak package:

```bash
cd flatpak
flatpak-builder --repo=repo --ccache --force-clean build io.missioncenter.MissionCenter.json
flatpak build-bundle repo missioncenter.flatpak io.missioncenter.MissionCenter
```

Install the package:

```bash
flatpak uninstall -y io.missioncenter.MissionCenter
flatpak install -y missioncenter.flatpak
```

Run the app from your launcher or from the command-line:

```bash
flatpak run io.missioncenter.MissionCenter
```
